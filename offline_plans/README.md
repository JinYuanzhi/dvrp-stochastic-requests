## Offline Plans

This folder contains the offline plans used in the computational experiments. Offline plans can be regenerated by using modes `3` (myopic plans) and `4` (potential-based plans) when invoking the app.

The format of each myopic plan file is `V-<Lambda>.myo.op`, where:

`Lambda` is the rate of dynamic requests (requests per minute).

The format of each potential-based plan file is `V-<Lambda>-<dist>-<K>.pb.op`, where, in addition to `Lambda`:

`dist` in {UTI, CTI, CTD} is the distribution of dynamic requests, and\
`K` is the (maximum) number of vehicles.

Note: the offline plan files are not intended to be edited manually. They are generated, imported and exported automatically by the app.
